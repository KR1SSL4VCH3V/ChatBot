# ChatBot with Learning Capabilities

This Python-based chatbot allows users to interact with a simple conversational AI. The chatbot can answer questions based on the pre-existing data it has, and it can also learn from users by asking for answers when encountering new questions. It utilizes the difflib library to find the closest match to user queries and stores new questions and answers in a JSON file for future reference.
